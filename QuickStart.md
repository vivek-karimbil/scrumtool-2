# Quick start guide

## Installing
Download the repository to your computer. All files are text files, except for a few images in the documentation folder. The documentation folder is not required to run the tool.

## Running the tool
Open the file scrumtool.html in Chrome. It has not been extensively tested on other browsers, and issues have been observed on the latest versions of newer browsers, including Edge.

## Usage
Fundamental philosophy: Software project = Team developing tasks in a series of sprints. This guide will work with the minimal setup to get started with a project, and expand on alternative workflows.

### First Plan
Open the scrumtool.html in your browser. You see the requirements screen, with a few colourfull rectangles on the left, near the top of the screen. Create a requirement for development, by dragging a coloured rectangle to the space below, which is the virtual project whiteboard. Then click the settings tab at the top of the screen - the one that looks like a gearbox. Thre are some icons for people - drag the blue one to the box below, to add a developer to the project. There are icons below the box for people, that represent sprints. Drag a blue one (with 'D' in the middle) to the box below it.
Select the scheduling tab, which is the third tab on the top of the screen - the calendar with a clock icon. The requiremen you created will be in the backlog box on the left. The sprint you created will appear in the table on the right. Drag the requirement to the table - on dragging something in the tool, the places you can drop them get highlighted. Drop the highlighted requirement in the first highlighted box. Click on the sprint icon at the start of the row to see the sprint editor.
There is a row for each developer, and the tasks created would be below the table. Drag the task to the row for the developer to assign the task in the appropriate status to that developer.
This is now a tiny project - one task to be done by the developer assigned, in the default time associated with a new task.

Thats all it takes to get started - the rest comes in the what if wuestions that ought to follow that minimalistic set of instructions above.

## Next Plans
Since most projects are more complicated than the one task - one developer - one sprint project we created above, let us explore further usage. Projects can be save to files in your download folder, using the save icon in the top right corner of the page. The browser settings to save a file created by a local web page will apply, so the browser settings will apply to where the file would be saved, and overwriting of existing files with the same name. On windos, Chrome creates a new version of a file if the name has already been used. THese files can be loaded to continue editing, so different versions of the plan over time can be saved and restored. Save before exiting the tool, to keep your last edits.

## Adding More Requirements
Drag and drop requirements and physically arrage them in ways that make sense to you. Five colours are provided by default, with the ability to change the colors of a note in the requirement editor. The pencil icon on the note allows the details of the note to be editted, including its name, estimated size and priority. The backlog tab - the first tab on the left - has three views in which to work with the backlog. The main view on selecting the tab is the whiteboard view to physically arrange the requirements to make visual examination convenient. THe other views are the priority view and the size view, that make visual sorting by size and priority a drag and drop task.

## Whiteboard
The default view for this tab is the whiteboard, where requirements can be added and physically moved around. There is no significance to the grouping or colours.

### Size View
The non-quantitative sizing of requirements is supported. Estimates can be made with the relative sizes of dust, grain, pebble, stone, rock, boulder and mountain, being converted to numbers representing actual efforts that you can edit in the settings tab.

## Priority View
The priority view allows the sorting of tasks by priority to be done visually. Tasks already created from these tasks will not be effected by this change.
