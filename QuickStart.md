# Quick start guide

## Installing
Download the repository to your computer. All files are text files, except for a few images in the documentation folder. The documentation folder is not required to run the tool.

## Running the tool
Open the file scrumtool.html in Chrome. It has not been extensively tested on other browsers, and issues have been observed on the latest versions of newer browsers, including Edge.

## Usage
Fundamental philosophy: Software project = Team developing tasks in a series of sprints. This guide will work with the minimal setup to get started with a project, and expand on alternative workflows.

### First Plan
Open the scrumtool.html in your browser. You see the requirements screen, with a few colourfull rectangles on the left, near the top of the screen. Create a requirement for development, by dragging a coloured rectangle to the space below, which is the virtual project whiteboard. Then click the settings tab at the top of the screen - the one that looks like a gearbox. Thre are some icons for people - drag the blue one to the box below, to add a developer to the project. There are icons below the box for people, that represent sprints. Drag a blue one (with 'D' in the middle) to the box below it.
Select the scheduling tab, which is the third tab on the top of the screen - the calendar with a clock icon. The requiremen you created will be in the backlog box on the left. The sprint you created will appear in the table on the right. Drag the requirement to the table - on dragging something in the tool, the places you can drop them get highlighted. Drop the highlighted requirement in the first highlighted box. Click on the sprint icon at the start of the row to see the sprint editor.
There is a row for each developer, and the tasks created would be below the table. Drag the task to the row for the developer to assign the task in the appropriate status to that developer.
This is now a tiny project - one task to be done by the developer assigned, in the default time associated with a new task.

Thats all it takes to get started - the rest comes in the what if wuestions that ought to follow that minimalistic set of instructions above.

## Next plans
Since most projects are more complicated than the one task - one developer - one sprint project we created above, let us explore further usage. The next few sections can be done in any order.

### Saving your work
Projects can be saved to local files in your download folder, using the save icon in the top right corner of the page. The browser settings to save a file created by a local web page will apply, so the browser settings will apply to where the file would be saved. The overwriting of existing files with the same name will be browser specific. On windows, Chrome creates a new version of a file if the name has already been used. THese files can be loaded to continue editing, so different versions of the plan over time can be saved and restored. Save before exiting the tool, to keep your last edits.

### Common actions - Edit and Delete
The pencil icon is used to edit the item on which it is clicked. The X icon is used to delete the icon. These appear on the top and right sides of the items they affect.

### Adding requirements to the backlog
More requirements can be added the same way as described earlier, by draging and dropping notes to the whiteboard. This is done on the backlog tab, the first tab on the top left. This tab stretches down a fair deal, so you can scroll for more space, or to group things together.

### Editing requirements in the backlog
Edit the notes by clicking on the pencil icon on the top right of each note on the backlog tab (the first tab on the top left). You can enter the name of the requirement, add a description, set the priority, the size, and set the colors for the note on the form that pops up. The name is seen in other parts of the tool. Notes can be used for any purpose - details of requirements, status during execution, links to other places or anything else. The priority and size can individually set here, or also in the bulk editors for these.

### Bulk editing of estimates and priorities
The backlog tab (the first tab on the top left) has 3 icons on the right - for bulk editing size, priority, and for the whiteboard view. The size view shows all items in the backlog.
