# Quick start guide

## Installing
Download the repository to your computer. All files are text files, except for a few images in the documentation folder. The documentation folder is not required to run the tool.

## Running the tool
Open the file scrumtool.html in Chrome. It has not been extensively tested on other browsers, and issues have been observed on the latest versions of newer browsers, including Edge.

## Usage
Fundamental philosophy: Software project = Team developing tasks in a series of sprints. This guide will work with the minimal setup to get started with a project, and expand on alternative workflows.

### First Plan
Open the scrumtool.html in your browser. You see the requirements screen, with a few colourfull rectangles on the left, near the top of the screen. Create a requirement for development, by dragging a coloured rectangle to the space below, which is the virtual project whiteboard. Then click the settings tab at the top of the screen - the one that looks like a gearbox. Thre are some icons for people - drag the blue one to the box below, to add a developer to the project. There are icons below the box for people, that represent sprints. Drag a blue one (with 'D' in the middle) to the box below it.
Select the scheduling tab, which is the third tab on the top of the screen - the calendar with a clock icon. The requiremen you created will be in the backlog box on the left. The sprint you created will appear in the table on the right. Drag the requirement to the table - on dragging something in the tool, the places you can drop them get highlighted. Drop the highlighted requirement in the first highlighted box. Click on the sprint icon at the start of the row to see the sprint editor.
There is a row for each developer, and the tasks created would be below the table. Drag the task to the row for the developer to assign the task in the appropriate status to that developer.
This is now a tiny project - one task to be done by the developer assigned, in the default time associated with a new task.

Thats all it takes to get started - the rest comes in the what if wuestions that ought to follow that minimalistic set of instructions above.
