# scrumtool-2

Scrum tool 2 is a follow on project, but not fully compatible with the original scrum tool (in this repository) (yet). The data model changed a bit to be more flexible, and this is not something that has been tested as yet. The inspiration behind this was to come to a more user friendly and lightweight way to do scrum, than the interfaces to industry strength tools with legacy UIs they cannot easily do away with.

There is still some work in progress to further make the setup screen less text heavy and to improve the support for testin activities.

There is now a need for a place holder between upgrades, hence a publish of this early version.
